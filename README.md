## Project Overview

The Data Privacy and Security Loan System was created to address the critical needs of modern loan management: security, transparency, and efficiency. By integrating real-time monitoring for unauthorized access and overdue repayments, the system provides actionable insights to administrators while maintaining a user-friendly experience for clients. Whether you're a client checking your loan status or an admin overseeing the entire system, this platform ensures data privacy and operational reliability.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Instantly detects unauthorized access attempts and overdue loan repayments.
- **Data Privacy**: Protects sensitive information with encryption and secure authentication.
- **Role-Based Redirection**: Clients access a Home Page, while admins access a Dashboard.
- **Failed Login Alerts**: Notifies admins when a client exceeds three failed login attempts.
- **Simple Authentication**: Uses MD5 hashing for password security.
- **Scalable Design**: Supports growth in users and loan volume.
- **Audit Logs**: Tracks all system activities for accountability.

---

## System Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture:
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS for user interfaces, with optional JavaScript for interactivity.
- **Backend**: PHP handles server-side logic, authentication, and database interactions.
- **Database**: MySQL stores user credentials, loan details, and monitoring logs.
- **Monitoring Layer**: Real-time scripts check for security breaches and repayment issues.

## Detailed Workflow

### Real-Time Monitoring

Real-time monitoring is the cornerstone of this system, ensuring proactive management of security and financial risks.

1. **Unauthorized Access Detection**:
   - Every login attempt (successful or failed) is logged with a timestamp, IP address, and username/email.
   - The system scans for suspicious activity, such as rapid successive failed attempts.
   - Alerts are generated and sent to the admin dashboard for immediate review.

2. **Overdue Repayments Tracking**:
   - Loan repayment schedules are stored in the database with due dates.
   - A background script runs daily to compare due dates with payment records.
   - Overdue loans are flagged, and details (e.g., client ID, amount, days overdue) are displayed on the admin dashboard.

### Client Authentication Flow

- **Access Point**: Clients begin at `client-login.php`, a PHP script handling registration and login.
- **Registration Process**:
  - Clients enter details like name, email, and password in a secure form.
  - The password is hashed using MD5 (more on this in [Security Implementation](#security-implementation)).
  - Upon successful registration, the client is logged in automatically.
- **Login Process**:
  - Clients submit their email and password.
  - The system hashes the entered password with MD5 and compares it to the stored hash.
- **Redirection**:
  - After successful login or registration, the client is redirected to the **Home Page** (`home.php`).
  - The Home Page displays loan details, repayment schedules, and account information in a clean, accessible layout.

### Admin Authentication Flow

- **Access Point**: Admins use `admin.php` for registration and login.
- **Registration Process**:
  - Admins provide a username, email, and password, often with an additional admin key for authorization.
  - The password is hashed with MD5 and stored in the database.
  - Successful registration logs the admin in automatically.
- **Login Process**:
  - Admins enter their credentials (username/email and password).
  - The system hashes the password with MD5 and verifies it against the stored value.
- **Redirection**:
  - Upon successful login or registration, the admin is redirected to the **Admin Dashboard** (`dashboard.php`).
  - The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of all clients, loans, overdue payments, and security alerts.

### Failed Login Attempt Alerts

- **Tracking Mechanism**:
  - Each failed login attempt on `client-login.php` increments a counter tied to the client’s email.
  - The counter is stored in the database or a session variable.
- **Threshold**:
  - If the counter exceeds **3 failed attempts**, the system triggers an alert.
- **Alert Delivery**:
  - An alert is sent to the **Admin Dashboard** in real time, displayed as a notification.
  - Details include the client’s email, number of attempts, timestamp, and IP address (if tracked).
- **Admin Action**:
  - Admins can lock the account, reset the password, or contact the client to verify identity.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional Bootstrap for styling).
- **Backend**: PHP 7.4+ for server-side processing.
- **Database**: MySQL 5.7+ for data storage.
- **Hashing**: MD5 for password security.
- **Server**: Apache or Nginx with PHP support.
- **Tools**: Git for version control, Composer for PHP dependencies.
